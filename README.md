# BuildAndDeployDacWithoutCLIToolsSample
Build and deploy SQL Server Database Project to Database using Microsoft.Build.Evaluation and DacFx.


# Note.

Since we are using SQL Server LocalDB as the database to deploy dacpac to, you will need to install SQL Server LocalDB if you want to run this sample as is.

If you want to deploy dacpac to another SQL Server instance, comment out the LocalDB-related code and set the appropriate connection string.
